#Tutorial Session

-Using your own Zotero library-go through that in class (give warning about not being able to do the third tutorial if there is no URL in the citations..)
-Find an example from someone else's work that I might be interested in...?
-Point of Zotero? We've talked in class about open access etc. And making your sources transparent (about how citing a document when it could have come from many different sources). With Zotero API you can put all of your information and make it available to people-complete transparency.

 Cavanagh: 'Conversations with knowledgeable colleagues may be valuable in this model, but they are generally not imperative for the mere existence of a project. In digital humanities, however, it is a rare scholar who is able to actualize an entire project without substantial contributions by a host of technologists, librarians, and others whose knowledge complements that provided by the scholar(s) envisioning an electronic product.'' Zotero and using Zotero API to share is one of those things-kind of like GitHub for bibliographies

Tutorial 1:
-Unicode 
-# On Zotero Tutorial 1
## For this to work on Windows you've got a few extra steps to go through first!
You want to enter `python -m pip install win_unicode_console` into the Command Line
​
After a successful install you will go into your Python interpreter with the simple command `Python`
​
Next you will want to import and enable, first with `import win_unicode_console` and then `win_unicode_console.enable()`
​
### Unicode will help your machine understand what we will be doing with Zotero and prevent the hiccups that Emily & I encountered with Professor Graham. Now you can follow the slightly different process outlined below to go through the Tutorial. There are a few nuances over when and how you input the commands shown by the tutorial
​
## Input the following commands on the Command Line in the Python interpreter. **This must be done right after you finished the Unicode process above (according to Graham the Unicode will not stick around and would have to be re-added if you close the Command Line)**
​
The Tutorial Commands for Windows are as follows (NOTE: capitalization matters and you should only be getting >>> after every command you put in unless otherwise stated):
* `from libZotero import zotero`
* `zlib=zotero.Library('group','155975','<null>','9GLmvmZ1K1qGAz9QWcdlyf6L')`
* `items = zlib.fetchItemsTop({'limit': 5, 'content': 'json,bib,coins'})`
     * At this point the Tutorial says you should have an output, but you should NOT.
* `for item in items:`
     * At this point the Tutorial says to include the rest of the command, but it should be included after!
* `     print 'Item Type: %s | Key: %s | Title: %s' % (item.itemType,item.itemKey, item.title)`
     * you need to include a series of 4 spaces before this `print` command. A series metadata should appear.
* `for item in items:`
     * At this point the Tutorial says to include the rest of the command, but it should be included after!
* `     print item.bibContent`
     * you need to include a series of 4 spaces before this `print` command. A series metadata should appear.

## SUCCESS

-Unicode needs to be downloaded everytime you open Python
